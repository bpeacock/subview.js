1. **Where are my models?!** - Subview is not *and will never be* an MVC framework. Subview.js is designed to be a View/Controller component that is used along-side other libraries for Models, Routing and Event Binding. So, you ask what should I use for my model? For now try the [Backbone.js model](http://backbonejs.org/#Model) and if you know of another stand-along model module please [add it here](https://github.com/bpeacock/subview.js/tree/gh-pages)!

2. **What is an object pool and why do I have to worry about all this cleaning stuff?** - Subview uses [object pools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern) to manage views rather than creating new views every time one is needed. By pooling objects, they are recycled which removes the overhead of recreating objects, prevents DOM element leaks and prevents DOM listener leaks. For example, using this technique yielded speed enhancements of about 60% for document loading in [FastFig](https://www.fastfig.com). However, it does mean that you have to clean up after yourself.

3. **I want 2-way data binding!** - Sorry, Subview.js specifically omits two-way binding because of the power it takes away from the developer to coordinate expensive changes to the DOM. This is very important when you want to create glossy-smooth animations and other frame-rate sensitive effects. However, Subview plays nice with other frameworks and you can use Subview for they components of your app that it best applies to.
